## **1. EPSC ‚Äì Excitatory Post-Synaptic Current**

* **Meaning:** Current **increases** in response to a stimulus (e.g., light pulse).
* **In a photodetector:**

  * When photons hit the channel, electron‚Äìhole pairs are generated.
  * The generated carriers increase the channel conductivity ‚Üí **drain current rises**.
* **Characteristic:** Positive-going transient; sometimes decays slowly due to trap states.

**Equation (typical form, simplified):**

$$
I_{\rm EPSC}(t) = I_0 + \Delta I \, e^{-t/\tau}
$$

* $I_0$ = baseline current
* $\Delta I$ = photocurrent amplitude
* $\tau$ = relaxation/decay time

## **2. IPSC ‚Äì Inhibitory Post-Synaptic Current**

* **Meaning:** Current **decreases** in response to a stimulus.
* **In a photodetector:**

  * Could occur if light induces **trapping of carriers** that reduces free carriers in the channel.
  * Or if a material has **photo-gating** effects that suppress conduction.
* **Characteristic:** Negative-going transient; current dips below baseline.

**Equation (simplified):**

$$
I_{\rm IPSC}(t) = I_0 - \Delta I \, e^{-t/\tau}
$$

üí° **In short:**

* EPSC ‚Üí ‚Äúlight turns **on** current‚Äù
* IPSC ‚Üí ‚Äúlight turns **off** current‚Äù

This is especially important in **photonic neuromorphic devices**, where light pulses emulate neural signaling.
