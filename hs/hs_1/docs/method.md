## **2. Experimental Section**

### **2.1 Device Fabrication**

* **Materials:** Multilayer MoS₂ and WSe₂, mechanically exfoliated from bulk crystals.
* **Substrate:** SiO₂/Si with 300 nm SiO₂ thickness.
* **Heterostructure Formation:**

  * MoS₂ and WSe₂ flakes were **dry-transferred** onto the substrate to form a p–n van der Waals heterostructure.
* **Electrode Fabrication:**

  * UV lithography used to pattern electrodes.
  * Thermal evaporation of Cr/Au (5 nm / 50 nm) for contacts.
  * Excess photoresist and metal removed by a lift-off process.
* **Result:** Formation of the three-terminal MoS₂/WSe₂ memtransistor with defined channel and contacts.

**Key Notes:**

* The device leverages the **van der Waals stacking** of 2D materials, which avoids lattice-matching constraints.
* Mechanical exfoliation ensures high-quality, defect-controlled layers for the memtransistor channel.

### **2.2 Material and Device Characterization**

* **Raman & Photoluminescence (PL):**

  * 532 nm laser used for excitation.
  * MoS₂: Raman peaks at 386 cm⁻¹ (E₂g¹, in-plane) and 408 cm⁻¹ (A₁g, out-of-plane).
  * WSe₂: Peaks at 250 cm⁻¹ (E₂g¹), 257 cm⁻¹ (A₁g), 310 cm⁻¹ (B₂g¹, interlayer).
  * PL peaks: MoS₂ \~680 nm, WSe₂ \~780 nm → confirms optical activity and band gaps.
* **Morphology and Thickness:**

  * **SEM:** Surface morphology of the heterostructure.
  * **AFM:** Thickness measured: MoS₂ \~10 nm, WSe₂ \~6.5 nm.
* **Electrical Measurements:**

  * **Output and transfer curves:** Measured with Keithley 4200 SCS parameter analyzer.
  * **Light pulses:** Delivered by CME-TLS-X300F monochromatic source.
  * **Electrical pulses:** Generated by Keithley 2636.
  * **Conditions:** Room temperature, air environment.

**Key Notes:**

* Raman and PL confirm **material quality** and correct thickness.
* Morphology characterization ensures **good contact and uniform channel** for consistent memtransistor behavior.
* Optical and electrical measurement setup allows for **dual-mode (electrical + optical) synaptic emulation**.

In short, the authors carefully prepared a **high-quality 2D MoS₂/WSe₂ p–n heterostructure**, patterned it into a three-terminal memtransistor, and confirmed both structural and optical integrity before electrical/optoelectronic testing.
