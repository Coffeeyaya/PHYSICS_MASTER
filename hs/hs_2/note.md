**Journal:** *ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces*, 2025, 17, 16970–16977

**Key Idea:**
The authors design a gate-tunable junction field-effect transistor (JFET) photodetector using MoSe₂/WSe₂ heterostructures. By leveraging both depletion-layer modulation and Schottky barrier control, the device achieves ultrahigh detectivity, high responsivity, fast response speed, and broad spectral detection.

**Key Findings:**

* Photoresponsivity of **476 A/W** at 635 nm.
* Specific detectivity of **1.55 × 10¹³ Jones**.
* High optical switching ratio > **10⁴**.
* Ultrafast response time of **50 μs** (rise) and **80 μs** (fall).
* Broad detection range: **635–1550 nm**.
* Mechanisms: gate modulation of depletion layer, Schottky barrier tuning, photogating + tunneling effects.

## **Figure-by-Figure Analysis**

**Figure 1:** Device structure and output characteristics

* (a) Schematic of MoSe₂/WSe₂ heterojunction JFET.
* (b) Optical microscope image.
* (c) I–V curves under different gate voltages in the dark → shows gate-controlled depletion layer modulation, enabling current suppression at negative VG and conduction at positive VG.

**Figure 2:** Electrical characterization under dark conditions

* (a) Device electrode configuration.
* (b) Transfer curves under various VDS (0.01–5 V). Shows strong n-type behavior. Threshold voltage shifts left with increasing VDS.
* (c) Negative differential resistance (NDR) observed when VDS > 1 V. Attributed to drain-side depletion region widening.
* (d) Output at different temperatures. NDR weakens at low T, showing thermionic emission dominance at RT, tunneling at low T.
* (e) Direct tunneling (DT) analysis using Simmons approximation → ln(I/V²) vs 1/V shows tunneling current contribution.
* (f) Schematic: depletion layer variations under different VG and VDS.

**Figure 3:** Photoresponse properties

* (a) Device under laser irradiation schematic.
* (b) Photocurrent mapping at 635 nm → localized at heterojunction.
* (c) Transfer curves under light → upward shift due to photogating effect.
* (d) Output under various laser wavelengths (635–1550 nm). Photocurrent persists into NIR.
* (e) Schematic of interband transitions explaining long-wavelength response.
* (f) Tunneling contribution enhanced by illumination.

**Figure 4:** Performance metrics

* (a) Responsivity vs VG: sharp increase at higher positive gate voltages, max at 476 A/W.
* (b) I–T curves under varying laser powers at 635 nm. Responsivity improves while dark current remains low.
* (c) High-resolution time response: rise = 50 μs, fall = 80 μs.
* (d) EQE vs incident power: peak \~10⁵% at low Pinc, decreasing with higher Pinc due to saturation.

**Table 1:** Comparison with other state-of-the-art 2D photodetectors.

* This device shows competitive responsivity, extremely high detectivity, and ultrafast response compared to previously reported heterojunctions.
