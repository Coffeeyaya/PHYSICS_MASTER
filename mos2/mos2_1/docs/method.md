## **Materials and Methods**

**Device Fabrication:**

* **Material:** Single-layer MoS₂ flakes were mechanically exfoliated from bulk crystals (SPI Supplies) and transferred onto highly doped Si substrates with a 285 nm thermally grown SiO₂ layer.
* **Channel:** Short-channel devices with lengths \~80–200 nm were prepared.
* **Contacts:** Two-probe Au electrodes were patterned using electron-beam lithography and deposition.

**Material Characterization:**

* Single-layer nature of MoS₂ flakes was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy.
* Device geometry was verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), shown in the inset of Fig. 1(b).
* Raman and AFM characterization (mentioned) support thickness identification and surface quality.

**Electrical Measurements:**

* Transfer characteristics (ID–VBG at VDS=10 mV) were measured to extract room-T mobility (0.3–2 cm²/Vs).
* Two-probe I–V curves were measured at various gate voltages and temperatures down to 105 K.
* Low-bias measurements confirmed quasi-ohmic contact behavior, ruling out Schottky/tunneling domination.
* High-bias measurements captured nonlinear current response needed to analyze SCLC.
* Temperature-dependent I–V sweeps were used to identify the transition from ohmic to trap-limited conduction and to extract the trap density.

**Notes on Reliability/Reproducibility:**

* Several devices (channel length \~80–200 nm) exhibited consistent behavior.
* Mobility values were relatively low, indicating disorder or extrinsic scattering in MoS₂.
* Critical voltage $V_c$ analysis was cross-checked across multiple temperatures and gate voltages to ensure consistency.
